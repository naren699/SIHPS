## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

Ministry of Railway

## Idea
* Create a system (mobile app and digital kiosks) that provides interactive station maps and step-by-step directions to facilities within railway stations. Include accessibility features like voice guidance for the visually impaired, and keep the maps updated in real time to reflect changes in station layout.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
* Build a mobile application with 3D station maps.

* Set up digital kiosks with touch screens at key locations in stations.

* Integrate with existing railway apps/services for data.

* Use a backend server that collects and updates station layout data.

* Implement voice navigation and accessibility features.

* The flow: User selects destination → App/Kiosk fetches route → Directions provided in text, map, and voice formats.

* Typical architecture:

* Mobile app (Frontend)

* Kiosk interface (Frontend)

* Navigation server (Backend/API)

* Data source (station layouts, updates)

* Accessibility module (voice/text options)

## Use Cases
* A new passenger enters the station and wants to find the nearest restroom.

* A traveler needs directions to platform number 3 for their train.

* Visually impaired person requests voice-guided navigation to the ticket counter.

* Regular updates show newly opened food courts or changes in waiting area locations.

* Passengers use the mobile app for navigation even before reaching the station.

## Technology Stack

* Frontend: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile apps), React.js (for kiosk interfaces)

* Backend: Node.js or Django for server/API

* Database: MongoDB or Firebase for storing map/layout data

* Maps: Mapbox or Google Maps SDK for 3D interactive maps

* Accessibility: Text-to-Speech libraries (Google TTS, Amazon Polly)

* Integration: APIs to connect with Indian Railway applications/services

* Deployment: Android/iOS devices, web kiosks.

## Dependencies
* Real-time access to station layout and facility data from railway authorities.

* Map SDK/API license for interactive features.

* Text-to-Speech service/API for accessibility.

* Secure authentication for user data and updates.

* Stable internet connection within stations for updating and syncing data.
